# Post with images

## Markdown

It is recommended that you save your images to the `./docs/_images` subfolder of the `master` branch of your repository.

![github pages](../_images/deploy-github-pages.png)

```Markdown
    ![title of the image](../_images/nameoftheimage.extension)        

    ![github pages](../_images/deploy-github-pages.png)
```
