In this purely informational section you can get:

- How long it is until **scheduled maintenance** (Quarterly/Yearly). Maintenance time changes according the model and it refers to that specified in the product manual. A progress bar with different colours (green, yellow, red) will be filled, day after day, starting from "day one" until recommended time has elapsed; at which point, it will be sent a **"maintenance required"** notification email to technical support.     


<kbd>![Scheduled Maintenance](_images/machine-manutenzione-program-eng.png)</kbd>

Click "show" button below each progress bar to view which components should be replaced during maintenance.

<kbd>![Components](_images/machine-componenti-eng.png)</kbd>

- **the number of cycles performed by head group express**. A progress bar with different colours (green, yellow, red) shows the wear status of all components. Once the component will have reached the maximum number of cycles, it will have to be replaced and a **"verify group"** notification email will be sent to technical support.  


<kbd>![Cycles](_images/machine-cicli-eng.png)</kbd>

- **The number of product disbursements** in last 24 hours of the maximum recommended daily. This is to make it clear if a coffee machine is used beyond its means, to avoid the loss of quality of products and rapid deterioration or to prevent the breaking of components.

- **the graph relative to the product vending data** that shows the sold products of your machines in the last seven days.
