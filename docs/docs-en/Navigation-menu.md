### CARIcare Logo

The logo, positioned at the center of the header, serves as a quick link to the **Dashboard**.
By clicking the icon, the user is automatically redirected to the platformâ€™s home page.

### Notifications

The bell icon indicates the presence of new notifications related to system activities or events.
When a red indicator is visible, it means there are unread notifications.
Selecting the icon opens a list of recent communications (e.g., machine errors or completed operations).
