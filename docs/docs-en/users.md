# Users

The **Users** section allows you to **view**, **add**, or **disable** the profiles associated with your account.
From here, you can monitor all registered users, viewing their **first name**, **last name**, **role**, and **email**, as well as the available actions for each.

## New User

To **create a new profile**, click the **Add New** button.

<kbd>![Add New User](_images/utenti-1.png)</kbd>

The **Add User** window will open, where you can enter:

* **First name** and **Last name** of the user
* **Email** for login
* **Role**, choosing between *Admin*, *Manager*, *Support*, or *User*

> **Note:** Each role has specific permissions.
> For example, **Admin** and **Manager** can create new users, while **only Admins** can add customers.

> **Note:** Users with the **Support** role can only view **machines assigned to them** as support technicians.
> They therefore cannot access the serial numbers or data of machines not linked to their profile.
