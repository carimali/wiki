# Notifications

At the top right of the **Dashboard**, the bell icon displays the **counter** for unread notifications.

Clicking the bell opens the **Notifications** panel, divided into **New** (unread) and **Old** (read/archived).

## What It Displays

* **Notification type** – Identified by an icon representing the nature of the event — *Error*, *Warning*, *Refill*, *Disconnected Machine* — or by a specific tag such as *Firmware Update*.
  Next to the icon, the **cause of the error** is also displayed (for example, *Door open* or *Low milk level*).

* **Timestamp details** – Below each notification, the **time of occurrence** is indicated, expressed in minutes, hours, or days elapsed since the event.


## Quick Actions
