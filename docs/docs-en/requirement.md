# Requirement

To access CARIcare you need credentials and a device that can connect to the Internet. For any questions please contact ict@carimali.com.

## Credentials

You will receive your credentials via email from caricare@carimali.com. Activation can be requested to your contact person. If you are a **<span style="color:#2A8BDD">Carimali</span>** customer, you can contact your sales agent or send an email to business@carimali.com: please specify *role*, *company* name and *password* in the mail body.

```EXAMPLE
Hello,
an account with role [ADMIN] for [customer name] was created.
Your password is: [1Hzv516gJZ]
```

If You have requested activation and it has been confirmed that credentials have been sent but you canâ€™t find the email in your inbox, please check spam folder, junk mail, trash, deleted items or archive.

I suggest You add caricare@carimali.com to the safe sender list in order to receive CARIcare emails correctly.

If you still can't find the email, please contact your reference person to get a new one.

## Connection and devices

Since CARIcare is an online platform, you must have a device that can connect to the Internet; the better the connection quality is, the better the user experience.

To properly view CARIcare, please use a device with a display on a screen width of minimum 4 inches and an installed browser; CARIcare is a responsive application and mobile optimized; however, the bigger the screen size is, the better the user experience.
