# Api


**Caricare** offers an API service that allows secure and direct access to your machinesâ€™ data and the main features of the system.

Access is granted through a personal **API key**, which uniquely identifies each user and ensures data protection.

### With the APIs, you can:

- View up-to-date data on your machines;
- Integrate platform data into your own business systems;
- Automate various management and monitoring operations.

## Api key

You can find your API key in your user profile page: 
on your Personal tab, click "**Edit Profile**"

## Api documentation

The documentation in **OpenAPI format** is available here:
